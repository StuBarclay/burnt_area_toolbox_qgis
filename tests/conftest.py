"""Pytest configuration: make the plugin package importable.

The plugin package ``burnt_area_toolbox`` lives directly under the project
root (one level above this ``tests`` directory). ``pyproject.toml`` already
sets ``pythonpath = ["."]`` for the common case; this belt-and-braces insert
keeps the tests importable when pytest is launched from another directory
(for example from within a QGIS Python console).
