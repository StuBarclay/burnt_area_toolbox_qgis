"""Shared help metadata for the Burnt Area Toolbox processing algorithms.

Kept deliberately free of any ``qgis`` import so the constant can be reused
(and unit-tested) outside a QGIS runtime. Every algorithm's ``helpUrl()``
returns :data:`HELP_URL`, which drives the "Help" button in the Processing
algorithm dialog.
