"""Pure policy for turning a raster layer's candidate sources into one path.

This module holds the *decision* behind
:func:`burnt_area_toolbox.algorithms._qgis_io.raster_source_path` with no
dependency on ``qgis`` or ``osgeo``, so the branch logic can be unit-tested in
the plain sandbox and in CI. The QGIS-specific probes (does a path exist, can
GDAL open a descriptor and wrap it in a VRT, can QGIS materialise the layer)
are injected as callables.

The policy has three tiers, tried in order:

1. A plain file that already exists on disk is used unchanged (the fast,
   zero-copy path).
2. Otherwise the first candidate that is a GDAL *dataset descriptor* -- a
   raster inside an ESRI File Geodatabase (``OpenFileGDB:"...gdb":layer``), a
   NetCDF/HDF subdataset, a ``/vsicurl/`` path or a WCS XML descriptor -- is
   wrapped in a tiny virtual raster (VRT). A bare descriptor is not a file on
   disk, so the compute core's ``path.exists()`` check would reject it; the
   VRT is a real file that references the descriptor and reads it lazily, so a
   large scene is never copied in full.
3. If nothing above works, the layer is materialised to a GeoTIFF.

        wrap_descriptor: Given a candidate, return the path to a VRT wrapping
            it (when GDAL can open it), or ``None`` when GDAL cannot -- so the

    The result is a self-contained ``<VRTDataset>`` string that bakes in the
    raster's size, projection and geotransform and points every band at
    ``source`` through a ``<SimpleSource>``. ``source`` is written into
    ``<SourceFilename relativeToVRT="0">`` (so GDAL passes it verbatim to
    ``GDALOpen`` rather than resolving it against the VRT's folder), which lets
    the descriptor be a plain file, an ESRI File Geodatabase raster
    (``OpenFileGDB:"...gdb":layer``), a NetCDF/HDF subdataset, a ``/vsicurl/``
    path or a WCS descriptor.

    Assembling the XML here -- rather than via ``gdal.Translate(..., "VRT")`` --
    guarantees a well-formed document that starts with ``<VRTDataset`` and is
    fully written to disk before use, which a ``gdal.Translate`` VRT over some
    subdataset sources was not (it produced a file GDAL then refused to reopen).
    Because the metadata is baked in, opening the VRT never touches the source;
    only a windowed read does, so a large scene is never copied in full.

    Args:
        width: Raster width in pixels.
        height: Raster height in pixels.
        source: The GDAL dataset descriptor (or file path) each band reads from.
        bands: One ``(gdal_datatype_name, nodata)`` pair per band, in order;
