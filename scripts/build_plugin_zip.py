"""Build the installable QGIS plugin ZIP, cleanly and reproducibly.

The QGIS Plugin Manager installs a ZIP whose single top-level entry is the
plugin package folder (``burnt_area_toolbox/``). This script packages exactly
that folder and nothing else: byte-code caches (``__pycache__``, ``*.pyc``),
the test suite, tooling caches and the dev/packaging scaffolding all live
outside the package or are skipped here, so they never reach a published ZIP.

Run it from anywhere::

    python scripts/build_plugin_zip.py

It writes ``burnt_area_toolbox.zip`` next to the package and prints a summary.
Entries are added in sorted order with a fixed timestamp so repeated builds of
an unchanged tree are byte-identical.
